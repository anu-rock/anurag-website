			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>
				Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Anurag Bhandari.
				I have been a generalist software engineer for more than a decade. From services to startup to research to consulting to product, I've been collecting and applying my skills pretty diversely. I've also authored two books on programming.
				I started my "enterprise" journey with .NET, switched over to JavaScript,
				and am currently heavy in PHP.
			</p>
			<h2>What makes me tick?</h2>
			<p>
				I subscribe to the jack of all trades philosophy.
				I strongly believe that to succeed in the ever-changing
				tech landscape of today, a software developer must constantly
				learn new skills as required at work.
				Gone are the days when specializing in one technology or
				stack could propel you in a traditional technical hierarchy.
