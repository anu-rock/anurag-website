I have been creating software professionally for more than 12 years. But my development journey goes back at least five years. The first software I wrote was probably a website I created for my dad’s business in 2005. I hosted it on a free subdomain, not unlike Yahoo Geocities.

### I am a generalist

<Bragging start>

During these long years, I’ve worked with a good deal of programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. I am easily excited and find it difficult to resist the urge to try new technologies.

When Ionic Framework was still in its infancy, I was spinning out mobile apps for internal clients. Migrating a fully-functional web app from AngularJS to Angular 2 (beta) was an adventure of a lifetime! I caught up with Flutter less than a year after its first stable release (and was modestly successful in promoting it as a viable mobile SDK at a large digital consulting firm).

Overall I’ve worked with a variety of languages and frameworks. My resume says that I can work intimately with JavaScript, Java, and Dart, and that I am comfortable working in PHP, C#, Ruby, and Python. You’ll also find an assortment of frontend and backend stuff I can work with.

### The key lesson of software engineering

If there’s one thing I have learned over the years, it’s this:

Software engineering is much bigger and harder than coding.

Wait! Aren’t coding, programming, development, and engineering one and the same? Sorry to disappoint you: they are not!
